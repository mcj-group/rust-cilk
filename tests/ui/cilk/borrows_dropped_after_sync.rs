#![feature(cilk)]
// Tests that borrows are not live after the cilk_sync point.

// build-pass
// compile-flags: -C panic=abort
// no-prefer-dynamic

// Note that this test can pass if the borrow is dropped at the end of the block being spawned
// rather than at the sync. There's another test that borrows are live before a sync.
